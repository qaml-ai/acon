# Host MCP Manager Tools

Use this skill when the user wants to:
- install or update a host MCP server
- store a host-side secret for later MCP use
- install a local `acon` plugin bundle from the managed workspace
- inspect bundled plugin `camelai.agentAssets`

The Host MCP Manager MCP server exposes these tools:

- `list_installed_servers`
- `prompt_to_store_secret`
- `install_stdio_server`
- `install_rest_api_server`
- `install_http_server`
- `uninstall_server`
- `list_installed_plugins`
- `install_workspace_plugin`
- `list_plugin_agent_assets`

## Rules

- Prefer this MCP server over ad hoc filesystem edits for host MCP server installs and plugin installs.
- Expect a host approval dialog for mutations. Do not claim success until the tool call completes successfully.
- Plugin `camelai.agentAssets` are reconciled declaratively on plugin load. Installing or refreshing a plugin automatically syncs its bundled skills and MCP configs into supported provider runtimes.
- If the user asks to create a plugin locally and make it available to the agent, the normal flow is:
  1. create the plugin files in the managed workspace
  2. call `install_workspace_plugin`
  3. optionally call `list_plugin_agent_assets` to confirm what the plugin declared
- If a tool is unavailable, say exactly which Host MCP Manager tool is missing.

## Tool guidance

### `list_installed_servers`

Use to inspect current persisted host MCP registrations before creating, updating, or deleting one.

### `prompt_to_store_secret`

Use when a host MCP server needs a secret.

- The agent never receives the raw secret back.
- The result is a `secretRef`.
- Use that `secretRef` in `envSecretRefs`, header secret refs, or REST API auth inputs.

### `install_stdio_server`

Use for a generic stdio MCP server that should be persisted in the host registry.

Provide:
- `id`
- `command`
- optional `args`
- optional `cwd`
- optional `env`
- optional `envSecretRefs`
- optional `name`
- optional `version`

### `install_rest_api_server`

Use when the user wants the builtin REST API MCP server.

Provide:
- `id`
- `baseUrl`
- optional auth config
- optional `name`
- optional `version`

Prefer this tool over manually constructing the builtin launcher command.

### `install_http_server`

Use for remote MCP servers over HTTP.

Provide:
- `id`
- `url`
- optional `transport` (`streamable-http` or `sse`)
- optional `headers`
- optional `headerSecretRefs`
- optional OAuth config
- optional `name`
- optional `version`

### `uninstall_server`

Use to remove a persisted host MCP server. Never try to uninstall `host-mcp-manager` itself.

### `list_installed_plugins`

Use to inspect currently discovered builtin and user plugins.

### `install_workspace_plugin`

Use to install or update a local `acon` plugin bundle from the managed workspace.

Provide:
- `path`: workspace-relative plugin folder path

Use this after the agent creates or updates plugin files in the workspace.
If the plugin declares `camelai.agentAssets`, the desktop backend will automatically sync those skills and MCP configs into Codex and Claude runtime state during plugin refresh.

### `list_plugin_agent_assets`

Use to discover which installed plugins declare bundled `camelai.agentAssets`.

This reports:
- bundled skill ids
- bundled MCP server ids
- install status by provider (`codex` or `claude`)

## Recommended flows

### Install a local plugin the agent just created

1. Create the plugin under the managed workspace.
2. Call `install_workspace_plugin`.
3. Optionally call `list_plugin_agent_assets` for that plugin id.
4. Tell the user what was installed and which providers received declaratively synced assets.

### Add a new host MCP server

1. If credentials are needed, call `prompt_to_store_secret`.
2. Install the server with `install_stdio_server`, `install_rest_api_server`, or `install_http_server`.
3. Summarize the installed server id and transport.

## Reporting

After using Host MCP Manager tools, report:
- which tool was called
- the ids affected
- whether the action installed, updated, removed, or only listed items
- any host approval dependency if relevant
